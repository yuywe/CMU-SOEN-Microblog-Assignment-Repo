    "## Assignment Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will work with Python functions, from the basics of their structure to more nuanced activities. You will start by reviewing what you learned about functions in earlier modules, then you will practice how to cast arguments inside of functions, how to use the local and the global environment, how to use nested functions, and then how to deal with exceptions. In the final part of the assignment you will be testing your knowledge of lambda functions and the basics of functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. **Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment.** Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client. \n",
